# flight-delay-prediction

As a **data scientist**, one of the most exciting aspects of our field is the ability to *turn data into actionable insights*. In this project, we will be extracting flight data from an airline company in Iran and using it to predict the delay of their flights. This is an important problem to solve because flight delays can cause significant inconvenience and even financial loss for passengers and airlines alike. By predicting which flights are likely to be delayed, the airline can take proactive measures to minimize the impact of these delays.

To accomplish this task, we will be using Python, a versatile and powerful programming language widely used in data science and machine learning. Python provides a wide range of libraries and tools that make it easy to manipulate and analyze large datasets, visualize data, and build predictive models. In addition, we will be using Jupyter Notebook, a popular interactive computing environment that allows us to combine code, text, and multimedia elements in a single document. This will allow us to explore the data, experiment with different models, and communicate our findings in a clear and accessible way.

Our first step in this project will be to gather the data. We will be extracting flight data from an airline company in Iran, which may involve dealing with missing or incomplete data, formatting issues, and other challenges. Once we have cleaned and organized the data, we will begin exploring it to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. This exploratory analysis will help us understand the factors that contribute to flight delays and inform our choice of predictive models.

Next, we will build a predictive model that takes into account various factors such as weather conditions, flight routes, and previous delays to predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed. We will evaluate the performance of our model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and fine-tune it as necessary to improve its performance.

Finally, we will use our model to make predictions on new data and assess its usefulness for the airline. By providing insights into which flights are likely to be delayed, we can help the airline take proactive measures to minimize the impact of these delays and improve the overall travel experience for passengers. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems and drive innovation in various industries.
